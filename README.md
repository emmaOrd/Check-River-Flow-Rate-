# Check-River-Flow-Rate-
Checks the flow rate of rivers using [USGS NWIS](https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval). Creates a map of favorite paddling spots and identifies spots within paddleable range (green) and out of range (red).
The USGS gauge locations and prefered flow rates are read in from a custom csv file (see in repository for example). Most suggested paddleable flow rates are from [American Whitewater](https://www.americanwhitewater.org/).
